### Code Challenge
You've been hired by a blogger to create a WordPress plugin for their DIY blog. They want a plugin that allows them to classify each post on their blog by difficulty, time and cost. They want to be able to edit these fields in the post edit screen and have them show up at the top of each post right before the post content.

### Rules
Create a Wordpress plugin that allows users to set a difficulty rating, a time estimate of how long to complete the DIY project and how much the materials cost. If a post has any of this information filled out, it should be displayed just above the content of the post. If no fields are filled out it should leave the content as is. Include a global settings page that allows the user to specify the background color of the DIY info added to the post.

### What we look for
We look for clean, well-architected code that would be easy for a maintainer to understand. We expect you to approach this as you would a production ready application.

### Guidelines/recommendations
Your code should be production ready and resilient. Try to get in the head of a user. User Experience can make or break a plugin.
Make sure your plugin works on older versions of PHP as well. A majority of the world still runs PHP 5.3
