# DIY-time-and-materials
A WordPress plugin for displaying time, materials and for DIY bloggers.

This is an example project that I wrote as part of an interview process. It is intended for demonstration purposes only. While you're free to use this code in any way you wish, there is absolutley no warranty or support. 

### Coding Standards
I applied both the WordPress, WordPress Practice coding standards using PHP_CodeSniffer, as well as php 5.3 compatability, which I grabbed from [here](https://github.com/wimg/PHP53Compat_CodeSniffer)
